# Mandela
A simple iOS customization tool based on [Nugget](https://github.com/leminlimez/Nugget). Works up to iOS 18.0db8.

## Usage
- Install pymobiledevice3 (`pip install pymobiledevice3`)
- Run `app.py`
- On first run, you'll be prompted to get the MobileGestalt file from your device. Send the shortcut link to your device, run it with Shortcuts, and put the file in the same folder as `app.py`
- Select your tweaks
- Apply tweaks
- Reboot device
- Profit

**If you enable Always-On Display or Stage Manager, you'll need to re-run the shortcut to enable full functionality.**

## TODOs
- Reverting tweaks ðŸ’€
- Custom MobileGestalt key tweaks
- More bug fixes
